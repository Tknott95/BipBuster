# BipBuster
this allows for precision breaks to limit computation in order to only bruteforce what bip slots you need with custom vextors of bips or the full 2048 bip list itself. This requires you to run your own cardano-node local with the cardano-wallet api, all by iohk. 
this can break into cardano wallets without the need of having all bips. It depends on conputation power but you can run throuhgh full bip lists (2048 bips) at just one bip slot.
will add the math down here so you can calc time it takes on whatever computation power you have (it is somewhere in a discord chan)
